# Activities Manager

It is a web app for daily activities and is intended for mobile phones.

I implemented next features in this project:

2. Personal activities page where a user can create, see and sort all personal activities;
3. Group activities page where are displayed only public activities created by user or where user is a participant;
4. All participations page which includes all activities created by user and also where user is a participant;
5. All groups where users can create new group or select from existing to show their ideas of activities or to find something interesting activities from other users;
6. Feed page which displays all users' activities ordered by created time.
