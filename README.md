# Activities Manager

## Description

I did this project for learning purposes as a capstone project from Microverse after completing the Ruby on Rails curriculum.
It is a web app for daily activities and is intended for mobile phones.

I implemented next features in this project:

1. User's page with link for navigation;
2. Personal activities page where a user can create, see and sort all personal activities;
3. Group activities page where are displayed only public activities created by user or where user is a participant;
4. All participations page which includes all activities created by user and also where user is a participant;
5. All groups page where users can create new groups or select from existing to show their ideas of activities or to find some interesting activities from other users;
6. Feed page which displays all users' activities ordered by created time.

## Built With

- Ruby on Rails
- Bootstrap

## Set up this projecect locally

1. Ruby
2. Ruby on Rails
3. PostgreSQL
4. Yarn
5. Node.js

- Open the terminal in the directory where you want to install the app;
- Run command `git clone git@github.com:iliebabcenco/contributions.git` which will clone the project;
- Switch to the main directory of project using cd;
- Run `bundle install` in your computer terminal to install required gems;
- Run `rails db:create` for creating the database on your local machine and also `rails db:migrate` for migration;
  (P.S. If you have any authentification errors with your database on running previous commands, you should got to the config/database.yml file and introduce in development section and also in test section two lines of code ex:
  `username: "postgres"`
  `password: 123456`
  where username is your local postgres user(usually it is postgres and your password))
- Run `rails server` to start the server;
- Open in your browser the URL http://localhost:3000/;
